        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
            SmallBiz E-Commerce was founded with one clear goal in mind: to make online selling simple, 
            affordable, and accessible for small businesses everywhere. We realized that while large 
            companies dominate the digital space, local shop owners often struggle to keep up. 
            Many lack the time, money, or technical expertise to build and manage complex online stores. 
            That’s where we come in.Our platform is designed to provide simple yet powerful tools that allow shop owners to set up their 
    online stores, manage their products, track customer orders, and accept secure payments—all in one place. 
    Whether you run a local bakery, a clothing boutique, or a craft store, SmallBiz E-Commerce gives you 
    everything you need to connect with customers online while keeping costs low.
